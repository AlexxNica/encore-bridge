<h1>Encore Bridge</h1>
<h4>Using <a href="https://rackerlabs.github.io/encore-ui/">Encore UI</a> with <a href="design.rax.io/design-system">Design System</a> styling</h4>

<h4>Goals</h4>
<p>
  This project aims to enable developers to use Encore components in customer-facing applications with minimal changes to the markup.  Since not all of the design patterns prescribed in Encore have a Design System equivalent, not every pattern or component has been migrated.
</p>
<p>
  This project does not intend to provide a single flag that can be flipped to turn an internal app into an external one.  Development must still target one of those platforms, but now the toolboxes for doing so are more similar.
